We can solve this problem by framing it as removing all paths from a DAG that have length greater than or equal to 3.

1. **Read Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases, `T`.
   - For each test case, read the number of landing spots (`n`) and the number of tracks (`m`).

2. **Initialize Data Structures:**
   - Create an adjacency list to store the outgoing connections for each spot.
   - Create an in-degree count array to track the number of incoming connections to each spot.

3. **Process Tracks:**
   - For each track, read the start (`a`) and end (`b`) spots.
   - Adjust the spots to zero-indexed values.
   - Update the adjacency list and increment the in-degree for the destination spot `b`.

4. **Topological Sorting:**
   - Use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting to assign levels to nodes/landing spots.
   - Initialize a queue with all nodes that have zero in-degree and process each node by visiting its neighbors, updating their in-degrees, and enqueuing them if their in-degree becomes zero.

5. **Determine Nodes to Remove:**
   - Use the levels derived from the topological sort to identify any nodes that would result in paths of length 3 or more:
     - If a node has a level difference of 3 or more with its descendants, mark it for removal.
   - Ensure the total number of nodes removed does not exceed the allowed bound (e.g., at most \( \frac{4}{7}n \)).

6. **Output Results:**
   - For each test case, print the number of nodes to be removed and their indices.
