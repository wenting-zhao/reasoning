1. `parse_test_cases() -> List[Tuple[int, int, List[int]]]`:
    - Parse the test cases from stdin. The first input will be the number of test cases. Each test case will have start with one line containing two integers, n and k, and a second line containing the barrel capacities. 
2. `max_possible_difference(n: int, k: int, barrels: List[int]) -> int`: 
    - Sort the barrels in descending order, the reverse python sort order.
    - Perform `k` operations by pouring water from the fullest barrel to second fullest barrel.
    - Return the capacity of the last poured barrel.
3. `main()`:
    - Call `parse_test_cases` and feed each test case to `max_possible_difference`, printing the result of each test case.
